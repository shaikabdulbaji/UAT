	 	overcome be detailed process od UAT testing.
	 2. creation of test plan and that test plan is revied by customers and stack holders and end users

	 	the challanges we face while test plan creation and review.
	 3. We should clearly mention in Test plan who is Product owner and who is project sponser and who is
	 	UAT team and we clearly mention their roles and responsibilites in that document otherwise it leads
	 	to complexity and so challenging.

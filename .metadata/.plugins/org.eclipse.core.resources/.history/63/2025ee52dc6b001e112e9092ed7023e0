	 UAT Testing Challenges
	 1. no process are influenced and defining a particular process is a great challange and this can be
	 	overcome be detailed process od UAT testing.
	 2. creation of test plan and that test plan is revied by customers and stack holders and end users
	 	and etc... and we can get approvala dn sign off from them and communication gap etc.. these are
	 	the challanges we face while test plan creation and review.
	 3. We should clearly mention in Test plan who is Product owner and who is project sponser and who is
	 	UAT team and we clearly mention their roles and responsibilites in that document otherwise it leads
	 	to complexity and so challenging.
	 4. For doing UAT testing the team will have right and good skill otherwise it would be so challenging.
	 5. We should have proper test environment setup and deployment process otherwise it is so challenging.
	 6. Test data gathering so what challenging only but We should have proper test data for doing 
	 	functional and non-functional testing otherwise it is so complexity and challenging too.
